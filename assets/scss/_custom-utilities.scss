/* The utilities
This is the meat of Tailwind CSS. Here resides almost all of the classes you use to style your HTML: from padding and flex classes, to shadows and colors, to pseudo-classes to animations and transitions.
The utilities layer is a good place to add simple utility-based classes. For example, you can add a class that makes a scrollable block to snap to its content with scroll-snap-type. */
